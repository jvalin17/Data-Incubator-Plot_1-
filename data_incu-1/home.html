          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p> Taste can be best described by dishes. The main objective is to make worth that one spends on eating outside. If you visit a new/unknown city, you can get best suggestions to eat based on what you love
            to eat depending on your location. Suppose, someone who likes to eat lebanese food. For example, one particularly likes chicken shwarma and hummus a lot
            ,he/she should get suggestions for places that make it best.Taking another example, the taste of starbucks coffee differ from store to store.
            My favorite is Java Chip lite but I don't like it at every store. So I would like to have best Java Chip coffee everytime,
             I spend money.I would like to get suggestions for a store that makes it good.
            A novel approach that might get you best of what you love.  </p>

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>My previous analysis shows that 'food' constitutes maximum weightage in rating of restaurant based on reviews. This approach is based on assumption that a user
          writes reviews. So in this approach the input is taken as all reviews in which user rates a place as 4 star or 5 star. I am considering
          uni-gram and bi-gram for name of a dish. A restaurant is assigned with dishes from its reviews that has more than 4 star or 5 star.
          Similarly for a user, if he/she mentions name of dishes in review with high rating it is assigned to users profile.
            If he/she doesn't take name of dish in review, top dishes (of restaurant) are assigned to that user.</p>
          <p>When a user asks for suggestions, a similarity algorithm is applied for a user and all restaurants around him in a radius of 2 miles and suggested most similar
          place to eat. If user has never given review, the system asks user for some input and gets suggestion based on it.</p>

          <h3>Data Pre-Processing</h3>
          <p>The reviews have to be classified for every city and ratings that is available in Yelp data-set. After getting classified reviews,
            it has to be further refined by removing stop words and tokenizing the uni-grams and bi-grams. A dat-set mentioning names of dishes have to be used to recognize dishes.
