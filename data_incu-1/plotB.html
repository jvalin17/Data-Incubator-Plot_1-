          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p> Time is an important aspect for business owners to get good rating. Being open at particular timings can boost business. 
The check-in data is considered along with business location. We can get the busiest hours of a business of a particular location. 
For example, restaurants have most check-ins in evening. A simple analysis can indicate that evenings are busiest. A detailed analysis can give data for busiest hours in that location. 
More part-time staff can be hired for those timings. Overall, it gives better range of time. </p>

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>Classify business based on business name and city. Clustering locations based on longitude and latitude of business. Identifying the range of hours that 
yields maximum benefits. Hourly range would make no difference so the time range has to be 2 or more hours. Analyzing number of check-in in those hours in a particular location 
cluster gives an insight on timings at which maximum customers can be expected. </p>

          <h3>Data Pre-Processing</h3>
          <p>Taking all different cities and business name. Classifying business based on business name and city. Using k-means clustering to cluster longitude-latitude co-ordinates. 
Add check-in values by matching with each business.</p>
